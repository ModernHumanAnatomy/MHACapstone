# Welcome to the MHA Capstone Project Page

On this site you will find all things **Capstone Project Related** for the [MHA CU Anschutz Master's Program](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ms-modern-human-anatomy).

The Capstone Project is the crowning experience of your Master of Science in Modern Human Anatomy degree.

## What's a Capstone Project?

The capstone project is the culminating experience of your tenure in the Modern Human Anatomy program. The goal of the Capstone project is to give you the experience of planning, implementing and presenting a research-based project. This means that you will have to come up with a rationale, a hypothesis, and a method to answer your hypothesis.

All capstone projects should demonstrate the ability to take an idea from conception to final presentation, combining anatomical knowledge, research capabilities, and professional skills into a coherent project.

To ensure that you are free to pursue the many opportunities offered by the Anschutz Medical Center and surrounding scientific community, we define a capstone project more by its indicators than its precise contents.

!!! abstract "Indicators of a Successful Capstone Project"

    A capstone project should:

    - Result in a novel scholarly deliverable which adds or contributes to an existing body of a knowledge.
    - Reflect a significant level of scholarship and creativity
    - Entail new learning for the student and demonstrate that the student has gained a new level of expertise.
    - Involve the characterization of a structure (or structures) ranging in scale anywhere from molecular to organismal or gross levels of organization.
    - Include at least one (and preferably more) of the following: 2D images, 3D images, animations or 3D models.

So, your Capstone project should generate new info or expand on current information; it should not just collate what is already known. That is, you must move beyond simply reporting factual information to generating new factual information of your own in a manner that distills the anatomical, research, analytical, and presentation knowledge that you have acquired over the course of your capstone experience.

Also, this is an Anatomy Program, so your Capstone Project should **characterize a biological structure** (or structures) at any scale ranging from the molecular to the organismal to the gross level. Finally, in recognition of the Modern component our program, your project must also include **some kind of imaging** as part of the analysis. 2D images, 3D volumes, 3D Surface models, and/or 3D Animations all meet this requirement.

## Deliverables

For your Capstone project, you will need to submit the following:

1. The Capstone Proposal
2. The Capstone Written Report
3. The Capstone Presentation (either poster or slide-talk)
4. A Data Plan and any final Digital Products

## So, why are we making you do this?

The goal of the Capstone project is to give you the experience of planning, implementing, and presenting a research or education-based project. This means that you will have to come up with a question and a method to answer this question. Part of the requirements of the capstone include:

- Write a Capstone Proposal
- Write a Written Report
- Create and present a scientific poster or talk

Many of our students have told us that their Capstone Project made them feel like a graduate student.

Sounds fun, right? Let's get started!
