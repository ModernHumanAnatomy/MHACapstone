# Evaluation

## Milestone Evaluations

Students receive grades on the following Major Milestone Assignments:

1. Capstone Proposal
2. Capstone Project
3. Capstone Presentation

## Grading Scale

Since Below a B- is considering failing in the graduate school, we use the following scale for scoring the rubrics

| Score | Grade | Category                            |
| ----- | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| 0.0   | F     | No evidence of Mastery              |
| 8.0   | B-    | Just passing, Major Deficiencies    |
| 8.2   | B-    | Poor                                |
| 8.5   | B     | Fair, Extensive Deficiencies, Major revisions needed            |
| 8.7   | B+    | Good. Some Deficiencies, Moderate Revisions needed     |
| 9.0   | A-    | Very Good, Some revisions needed    |
| 9.2   | A-    |                                     |
| 9.3   | A     | Great, Minor Revisions              |
| 9.5   | A     | Excellent, shows Mastery            |

To evaluate these assignments, we use the following Rubrics:

3. The Capstone Mentor's Performance Evaluation of the student
