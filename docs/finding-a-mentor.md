# Finding a Mentor

The Capstone Project represents an inflection point in your advisement. When you start your Capstone, you build your own team of advisors in the form of the Capstone Committee. This committee is comprised of the following members:

- The **Capstone Mentor**: the person who helps design the project and, provides most of the training
- The **Capstone Chair**: an MHA faculty member who can provide feedback on the project and ensure that the project meets MHA requirements and deadlines. Can be the same as the First-Year advisor.
- **Third Committee member**: at least one additional member who can provide feedback on the capstone project, review written documents, and provide training as needed.
  


NOTE: All Committee members will grade your capstone project assignments and determine your final capstone project grade
