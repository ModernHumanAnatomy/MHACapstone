# The ABSTRACT FORMULA

Maureen Estevez Stabio, PhD
University of Colorado School of Medicine

-   **TITLE LINE AND AUTHORS:**

    1.  Title should be short, concise with all key info. NO ACROYNMS in
        the title!

    2.  First author = presenting author ðŸ¡ª middle authors ðŸ¡ª Last author
        = Senior author

    3.  Include affiliations

-   **INTRO/BACKGROUND:**

    1.  **FIRST: What is known?**

        -   [The first two words of this sentence]{.underline} are key
            and should prime the reader with the topic of your research
            project. In other words, if your proposal is about autism,
            then autism should be in the first few words of the first
            sentence. On the other hand, if your grant is really about
            the development of cortical neural circuits and a long-term
            potential application of your work is for developmental
            disorders, then DON'T make the first word of the first
            sentence "autism". If you do this, you will prime your
            reader to think the project is about autism, when it is
            really about neural circuits, and the reader will be misled.
            In this case, the first sentence should have the words
            "development of neural circuits", and the clinical
            application should come later.

        -   [Second sentence or two: What is the state of current
            knowledge]{.underline}? Here provide a brief sentence or two
            about what is known, and refer to the existing literature.
            **You must refer to the existing literature here**. This
            should not go on for pages and pages. Pick the most relevant
            pieces of information that build an understanding for the
            importance of your work in 1-2 sentences.

    2.  **NEXT: Where is the gap in knowledge? What is the
        problem/controversy?**

        -   [What is the unmet need]{.underline}? What is not known or
            what has been challenged recently?

        -   You can use phrases like, "This leaves an unsolved
            problem..." or "However, it is unknown if X modulates Y", or
            "However, xyz remains poorly understood".

        -   If appropriate here you can state explain who cares: "This
            is important because pharmaceutical treatments cannot be
            developed without understanding this key mechanism."

> **3. LAST: Focus on goals. How did you come to the rescue to fill the
> gap?**

-   Clearly state what you did to fix this gap in knowledge or unmet
    need.

    -   State long-term goal or overarching objective of the research.

    -   You can use phrases like, "The goal of this project was to...."

    -   Here, if appropriate, you should also include a hypotheses

<!-- -->

-   **METHODS:**

1.  **Clearly state the methods used to achieve the goal or test the
    hypothesis.**

-   You do not need to go into exhaustive detail, but it is important to
    give the reader an idea of what was done! Mice? Humans? Behavioral?
    Histological? Electrophysiological?

-   For example, you use phrases like, "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_method(s) was used
    to determine \_\_\_\_\_\_". For example, "Viral tract tracing in
    reporter mouse line of X was used to determine the retinal ganglion
    cells that innervate the dorsal lateral geniculate of the thalamus."

2.  If human subjects, indicate "in an IRB approved protocol"

3.  Include how data were analyzed.

-   **RESULTS:**

    1.  You must have results. Even if they are preliminary. Don't say
        "we expect xyz"

    2.  Include N values, statistics, etc.

-   **CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION:**

    1.  Carefully interpret the results. The conclusion must be accurate
        to what your results actually show!

    2.  This suggests x, y, z. Future recommendations

    3.  Take home message: What's the payoff? Significance! What is the
        impact to the world?
