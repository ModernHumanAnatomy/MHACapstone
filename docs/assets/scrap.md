## So, why are we making you do this?

The goal of the Capstone project is to give you the experience of planning, implementing, and presenting a research or education-based project. This means that you will have to come up with a question and a method to answer this question. Part of the requirements of the capstone include:

- Write a Capstone Proposal
- Write a Written Report
- Create and present a scientific poster or talk
