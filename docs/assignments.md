# Capstone Assignments

To ensure your project stays on track, we have created a series of assignments that need to be submitted to successfully complete your Project. 

These assignments are organized chronologically and categorically as follows:

These are the assignments that need to be completed before you can register for the Capstone Project. They are collectively known as the Capstone Authorization Packet.

- Mentor/Student Agreement
- Alternate Timeline Worksheet (excel file)
 

The following is a partial list of such assignments:

- Project Scope of Work
- Capstone Proposal
- Finalize Committee
- [The Capstone Proposal](capstone-proposal-guidelines.md)
- The Capstone Presentation
- [The Capstone Written report](written-report-guidelines.md)

You can find the full list of assignments on one of the following dedicated Canvas Pages:

**Standard Track Canvas Page:** Students on the Standard Timeline should sign up for this canvas page. This Canvas page has set deadlines for each assignment so students can complete their Capstone Project by the second semester of the second year.

**Alternate Track Canvas Page:** This canvas page has all of the same assignments as the Standard Track page, but does not have set deadlines for each assignment. The student will have to work with their committee to create their own personal deadline schedule for the assignments. [Alternate Page Sign-up LINK.](https://ucdenver.instructure.com/enroll/HYNNPW)

You can find more details on the Standard and Alternate timelines [here](timeline.md).

Please contact Dr. Salcedo for any issues signing up for a Canvas Page.
