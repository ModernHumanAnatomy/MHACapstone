Note, you do not need to include subheaders in the B&amp;R.</p> <code>First Sentence</code> <p>The very first (or second) word in the first sentence should encapsulate what the entire capstone project is about. For example, if you characterized the volumes of meningiomas across males and females, then your project is about Meningiomas and your first sentence should start something like \"Meningiomas are typically benign tumors arising from the meningeal tissue of the brain.\" Don't start with the method (\"We used Slicer to measure meningiomas in the Brains of Males and Females\"). If you start by discussing the method, then this becomes a method paper about using Slicer, which is typically not what you are doing.  So, start with the clinical or anatomical relevance of your project. And don't even mention Slicer (or whatever specific method you used) until the Methods Section.</p> <code>Background</code> <p>The background details what is known. Remember to only include information  directly relevant to your project. Be sure to include a description of the anatomy involved and any clinical relevance, such as incidence rates or prognosis. If your project was a methods paper or an educational project, then you want to discuss the current technology or educational resource being employed, and the extent to which it is available. Be sure to include a clarifying figure to explain the anatomy in question and how your project relates to that anatomy.

Talk about  the rationale for the experiment that led to the result.
